Quickselect
It is able to find the Kth smallest/largest element in an unordered array. It has O(N) linear running time.
The concept is similar to that of Quicksort but instead of recursing both side, we just take one.

algorithm
1.) Choose a so called pivot item at random
2.) Partition the array
3.) Instead of recusion on both side, we just take one.

The partition phase
the partition method is jsut for partitioning the array to the pivot.
Chose a pivot at random,
Re arrandge the array in a way that all elements less than pivot are on the left side and all the elements greater than the pivot are one the right side.
Partion returns the final position of the pivot.

The selection phase
After partitioning there may be
K == pivot - We doubdn the kth index
K < pivotthe kth smallest item is on the left side if the pivotm discard the other subarray
K > pivot - the kth smallest item is on the right edge of the pivt
